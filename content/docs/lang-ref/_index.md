# About Language Reference

This part of the book describes the formal grammar of the Yan programming language.

## How to Read the Grammar

The notation used to describe the formal grammar of the Yan programming language follows a few conventions:

- An arrow (→) is used to mark grammar productions and can be read as “can consist of.”
- Syntactic categories are indicated by italic text and appear on both sides of a grammar production rule.
- Literal words and punctuation are indicated by boldface constant width text and appear only on the right-hand side of a grammar production rule.
- Alternative grammar productions are separated by vertical bars (|). When alternative productions are too long to read easily, they are broken into multiple grammar production rules on new lines.
- In a few cases, regular font text is used to describe the right-hand side of a grammar production rule.
- Optional syntactic categories and literals are marked by a trailing subscript, opt.
